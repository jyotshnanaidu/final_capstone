# Mapping and Predicting Crime Hotspots Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project analyzes crime data from Los Angeles (2020–Present) to identify spatial crime hotspots and predict the likelihood of arrests using machine learning and deep learning models. The goal is to support data-driven policing and public safety decision-making through clustering, classification, and visualization techniques.

## Key Features
- 📍 **Hotspot Detection** using DBSCAN clustering
- 🧠 **Arrest Prediction** using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and LSTM models
- 🧪 **SMOTE** applied to handle class imbalance
- 📊 **PCA** for dimensionality reduction and visualization
- 🌐 **Folium Heatmaps** and visual analysis of spatial patterns
